## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed

#### üêõ Bug #1: Classification Fallback to Cardiology
- **Root cause**: Non-medical topics were incorrectly defaulting to "Cardiology" due to poor keyword ordering and fallback logic
- **Symptoms**: Mandarin language teaching classified as Cardiology instead of Linguistics, cultural topics misclassified
- **Fixes applied**:
  - Expanded taxonomy from 20 to 22 classes (added Psychology and Education to HUMANITIES domain)
  - Reordered keyword matching to check specific terms before generic ones (e.g., "machine learning" before "learning", "language teaching" before "teaching")
  - Added comprehensive debug logging showing classification decisions with emoji indicators
  - Added API-based classification fallback using Claude for ambiguous cases
  - Added context-aware checks to distinguish between similar keywords (e.g., language teaching vs general teaching)
  - Medicine classification now requires explicit medical keywords, not just domain proximity
- **Test results**: ‚úÖ 14/14 classification tests passed
- **Impact**: Mandarin/Chinese topics now correctly classify as Linguistics, cultural topics as Cultural Studies, no more Cardiology false positives

#### üêõ Bug #2: Name Race Condition (Duplicate Agent Names)
- **Root cause**: Async race condition during concurrent agent creation - multiple agents checked `used_names` before any registered their names
- **Symptoms**: Duplicate names like "Dr. Mei-Ling Chen" appearing for different agents during concurrent creation
- **Fixes applied**:
  - Added `asyncio.Lock` (`_name_lock`) to protect `used_names` set during name checking and registration
  - Added `used_names: Set[str]` attribute to track all agent names in memory
  - Added `_load_existing_names()` method to scan disk and load existing agent names at factory initialization
  - Added retry logic (up to 3 attempts) with updated prompts listing recently-used names to avoid
  - Added fallback numbering if all retries fail (e.g., "Dr. Smith 2", "Dr. Smith 3")
  - Wrapped name uniqueness check in `async with self._name_lock:` to ensure atomic check-and-register
- **Test results**: ‚úÖ All tests passed - 5 agents created concurrently with 0 duplicates, retry logic successfully regenerated 2 duplicate names
- **Impact**: Guarantees unique agent names even during high-concurrency scenarios

### Changed

- **Agent taxonomy**: Now 22 classes instead of 20 (added Psychology and Education to HUMANITIES)
- **Classification logging**: Added comprehensive debug output showing keyword matches, confidence scores, and decision paths
- **Classification priority**: Reordered checks so specific terms (machine learning, bilingual, language teaching) match before generic terms (learning, teaching)
- **Agent factory imports**: Added `asyncio` import for async lock support

### Added

- **Test suites**: Added `test_classification_fix.py` (14 test cases) and `test_name_uniqueness_fix.py` (concurrent creation testing)
- **Classification fallback**: API-based classification using Claude for ambiguous cases when keyword confidence < 0.3
- **Name loading**: Factory now loads existing agent names from disk at initialization to prevent duplicates across sessions

- **AgentCoordinator class**: Central orchestration for dynamic agent lifecycle (`src/agent_coordinator.py`)
- **AgentFactory**: Template-based agent generation with Claude API (`src/agent_factory.py`)
- **DynamicAgentRegistry**: Agent storage and retrieval system (`src/dynamic_agent_registry.py`)
- **PerformanceTracker**: Rating history and analytics (`src/performance_tracker.py`)
- **AgentLifecycleManager**: Tier management and retirement logic (`src/agent_lifecycle.py`)
- **AgentDeduplicator**: Similarity detection and duplicate prevention (`src/agent_deduplicator.py`)

#### üìä Post-Conversation Rating Flow
- **Interactive rating prompt**: Rate each agent after conversation completes
- **Promotion notifications**: Celebrate when agents level up ranks
- **Performance dashboard**: Display agent statistics, ranks, and scores
- **Rating persistence**: Store all ratings with timestamps and conversation context
- **Weighted scoring**: Configurable weights for different rating dimensions

#### üéØ Integration with coordinator_with_memory.py
- **Seamless integration**: Drop-in replacement for static Nova/Atlas agents
- **Fallback mode**: Automatically reverts to static agents if dynamic system fails
- **Database compatibility**: Works with PostgreSQL and Qdrant persistence
- **All features preserved**: User injection, tool visibility, state management, metadata extraction
- **Enhanced topic analysis**: Uses OpenAI for better agent selection

### Fixed

#### üîë OpenAI API Key Three-Way Sync
- **Root cause**: Settings menu only updated `settings.json`, not `.env` file
- **Fix**: Added `_update_env_file()` method to `settings_manager.py`
- **Three-way updates**: Now syncs `settings.json`, `.env` file, AND process environment
- **Methods updated**: `set_openai_api_key()` and `set_anthropic_api_key()`
- **Impact**: API key updates now take effect immediately after restart

#### ü§ñ Agent Prompt Lazy-Loading
- **Root cause**: AgentRunner only loaded prompts for agents in `config.yaml` at initialization
- **Fix**: Added lazy-loading logic in `send_message_streaming()` and `send_message_to_agent()`
- **Behavior**: Dynamic agents now load prompts on-demand from disk and cache them
- **Impact**: Dynamic agents can now run without pre-configuration

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Extended Thinking Token Limits
- **Root cause**: Default `max_tokens=2048` was less than `thinking_budget=5000`
- **Error**: "max_tokens must be greater than thinking.budget_tokens"
- **Fix**: Changed default from 2048 to 8000 in both `send_message_to_agent()` and `send_message_streaming()`
- **Impact**: Extended thinking now works correctly for dynamic agents

### Changed

- **Agent file structure**: Dynamic agents stored in `.claude/agents/dynamic/` subdirectory
- **Agent ID format**: Dynamic agents use `dynamic/<hash>` pattern (e.g., `dynamic/dynamic-a551f2bec1c4`)
- **Path extraction**: Fixed agent ID extraction to preserve subdirectory structure
- **Settings validation**: Enhanced API key validation with test calls
- **Configuration**: Added Phase 1E settings to `config.yaml` (openai, agent_factory, agent_lifecycle, rating, taxonomy)
