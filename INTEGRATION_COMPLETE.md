**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Status**: Ready to use
**Backup**: `coordinator_with_memory.py.backup`

---

## What Changed

### Files Modified
- `coordinator_with_memory.py` - Enhanced with dynamic agent system

### Files Unchanged (All preserved)
- ✅ PostgreSQL persistence
- ✅ Qdrant vector memory
- ✅ Conversation continuation
- ✅ User content injection (Ctrl-C menu)
- ✅ Metadata extraction & dashboard
- ✅ All existing features

---

## New Features

### 1. Dynamic Agent Creation
- Agents are now created **on-demand** based on conversation topic
- System analyzes topic → identifies expertise → creates/reuses specialists
- Example: "Ancient Mesopotamian agriculture" → Creates agriculture historian + ancient civilizations expert

### 2. Agent Deduplication
- System reuses existing agents when similar expertise exists
- Saves creation costs (~$0.004 per agent)
- Example: If "Physics Expert" exists, won't create another one

### 3. 5-Dimension Rating System
After each conversation, rate agents on:
- 🤝 Helpfulness (1-5)
- 🎯 Accuracy (1-5)
- 📊 Relevance (1-5)
- 💡 Clarity (1-5)
- 🤝 Collaboration (1-5)

### 4. 6-Rank Promotion System
Agents level up based on performance:
- 📗 NOVICE (0-9 points)
- 📘 COMPETENT (10-24 points)
- 📙 EXPERT (25-49 points)
- 📕 MASTER (50-99 points)
- 🔮 LEGENDARY (100-199 points)
- ⭐ GOD_TIER (200+ points) - Never retired!

### 5. Lifecycle Management
- 🔥 HOT - Currently active
- 🌡️ WARM - Used within 7 days
- ❄️ COLD - Used 7-90 days ago
- 📦 ARCHIVED - 90+ days unused
- ⚰️ RETIRED - Deleted (pattern saved)

### 6. Leaderboard
Tracks top-performing agents across all conversations

---

## How to Use

### Starting a Conversation

```bash
python3 coordinator_with_memory.py
```

**What happens now:**

1. System loads dynamic agent management
2. You create a new conversation with a topic
3. System analyzes the topic
4. Creates or reuses specialized agents
5. Conversation proceeds normally
6. **NEW**: After conversation, you rate each agent
7. **NEW**: System shows leaderboard and statistics

### Example Flow

## Key Integration Points

### Where Dynamic Agents Are Used

**Line 337**: AgentCoordinator initialized
```python
agent_coordinator = AgentCoordinator(verbose=False)
```

**Line 507**: Dynamic agent creation
```python
agents_profiles, metadata = asyncio.run(
    agent_coordinator.get_or_create_agents(topic)
)
```

**Line 768**: Rating flow
```python
promotions = asyncio.run(
    agent_coordinator.rate_agents_interactive(agent_ids, conv_id)
)
```

---

## Fallback Mode (Emergency Only)

If `AgentCoordinator` fails to initialize, the system automatically falls back to the original static agents from v0.1.0 (**Nova** & **Atlas**).

You'll see:
```
⚠️  Falling back to static agents (Nova & Atlas)
```

**Note**: This is an **emergency fallback only** - it should rarely occur. The dynamic agent system is the default and recommended approach. Nova and Atlas are the legacy agents from the project's inception and are preserved for backwards compatibility.

👉 **Learn about their history**: [ATLAS_NOVA_LEGACY.md](ATLAS_NOVA_LEGACY.md)

---

## Data Storage

All dynamic agent data is persisted to:

```
data/
├── agents/           # Agent profiles (JSON)
├── performance/      # Performance history (JSON)
├── ratings/          # Individual ratings (JSON)
├── leaderboard/      # Leaderboard cache (JSON)
└── conversations/    # Conversation metadata (JSON)
```

Agent prompt files:
```
.claude/agents/dynamic/
├── agent_12345.md    # Dynamically created agent prompts
├── agent_67890.md
└── ...
```

---

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert to the old system:

```bash
cp coordinator_with_memory.py.backup coordinator_with_memory.py
```

This restores the original Nova/Atlas static agent system.

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Simple Topic
```
Topic: "Tell me about quantum mechanics"
Expected: 1-2 physics/science experts created
```

### Test 2: Multi-Domain Topic
```
Topic: "How did ancient civilizations use mathematics in architecture?"
Expected: 2-3 agents (historian, mathematician, architect)
```

### Test 3: Agent Reuse
```
First conversation: "Quantum mechanics"
Second conversation: "Particle physics"
Expected: Physics expert from first conversation is reused
```

### Test 4: Rating & Promotion
```
Complete a conversation
Rate all agents with 5s
Expected: Agents gain 5 points each, may get promoted
```

### Test 5: Leaderboard
```
Complete 3-4 conversations with different topics
Expected: Leaderboard shows top-performing agents
```

## Configuration

Settings are in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# OpenAI for topic refinement
openai:
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 1000

# Agent factory settings
agent_factory:
  max_concurrent_agents: 5
  default_model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
  enable_dynamic_creation: true

# Lifecycle settings
agent_lifecycle:
  warm_days: 7
  cold_days: 90
  archive_days: 180
  enable_auto_retirement: false

# Rating system
rating:
  enable_post_conversation_prompt: true
  skip_if_short_conversation: true
  min_turns_for_rating: 3
  weights:
    helpfulness: 0.30
    accuracy: 0.25
    relevance: 0.20
    clarity: 0.15
    collaboration: 0.10
```

---

## Known Issues

### OpenAI API Key
If you see:
```
⚠️  Topic refinement unavailable (OpenAI API error)
```

**Solution**: The system falls back to basic topic extraction. To fix:
1. Add credits to OpenAI account
2. Verify API key in settings
3. System will automatically use GPT-4o-mini for better topic analysis

---

## What's Preserved

✅ **PostgreSQL conversations** - All conversations still saved to DB
✅ **Qdrant vector search** - Semantic search still works
✅ **Conversation continuation** - Can still continue old conversations
✅ **Ctrl-C menu** - Interrupt handler with context view
✅ **User injection** - Can inject content mid-conversation
✅ **Token tracking** - Full cost calculation
✅ **All display modes** - Simple, detailed, geeky stats

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run a test conversation** with a simple topic
2. **Rate the agents** to test the promotion system
3. **Run multiple conversations** to see agent reuse
4. **Check the leaderboard** to see top performers
5. **Explore data/** directory to see persisted state

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs**: Errors will be printed to console
2. **Verify data/**: Make sure `data/` directory is writable
3. **Test Phase 1E standalone**: Run `python3 enhanced_coordinator.py --topic "test"`
4. **Rollback if needed**: Use the backup file

---

**Integration Status**: ✅ Complete and ready to use!

Enjoy your dynamic multi-agent system! 🎉
